Had to refactor code that appears deliberately made to be obtuse as possible. Changed all the created classes to semantic markups that already existed. Combined redundant classes into single markup. removed unneccessary id tags. changed title to more descriptive name. added comments indicating what each section of the page does. Left "float-left" and "float-right" the way they were since those classes seemed to actually be doing a pretty good job, and i was running out of semantic markups to use. My frustration is immeasurable and my evening is ruined.
